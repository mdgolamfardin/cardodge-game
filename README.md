# Car Dodge Game

## Description
The Car Dodge Game is a fun and interactive Python game, based on a project from the python course I am doing by Dr. Angela Yu on udemy, where the player controls a character attempting to avoid oncoming traffic. The game increases in difficulty as the player progresses, making it a challenging and engaging experience.

## Features
- Dynamic car generation with varying speeds and colors.
- Responsive player controls for moving across the game screen.
- Score tracking that increases with the player's level.
- Game over scenario with restart capabilities.
